# Vagrant File + Ansible role for installing IMC.

You will need to download the iMC files yourself.

In the vagrant directory, create the folder "install". Unpack the iMC zip file under this.

Then build the VM with "vagrant up"

Note it will take a little while to do the initial install.

TODO:

* Test it out with other providers - e.g. VMware, Digital Ocean, etc.
* Figure out how to get automated patching working
